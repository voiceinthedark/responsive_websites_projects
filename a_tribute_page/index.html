        <ul id="timeline">
            <li>1822 - Louis Pasteur is born</li>
            <li>1847 Louis goes to college</li>
            <li>1849 Louis gets married</li>
            <li>1854 Louis' becomes a professor of science            
            Louis began his work as a professor, and one of his duties included finding scientific solutions to common problems in
            the area.</li>
            <li>1855 Louis finds bacteria in the drink            
            Louis was assigned the job of figuring out why common drinks like beer and wine became sour. He discovered the bacteria
            growing in the drinks, and figured out that if you boiled the drinks and then cooled them, it killed the bacteria.</li>
            <li>1856 Louis returns to Ecole Normal
            
            Louis returned to his old school, but this time as a professor.</li>
            <li>1864 He studies where the bacteria came from
            
            Pasteur went on to study where the bacteria growing in food and drinks were coming from, and he finally figured out it
            came from the air or environment.</li>
            <li>1864 The Germ Theory
            
            Many people in the 1800's still believed that germs were not harmful to people. Louis proved that germs were the cause
            of illness.</li>
            <li>1865 Louis saves the silkworms
            
            After his success with the beverage industry, Louis was asked to work on the dying crops of local silk fields. He
            figured out the silkworms were ill, and introduced a way to fix the problem.</li>
            <li>1868 Louis becomes ill
            
            Louis suffered from a small stroke and it left him partially paralyzed, but he was still able to experiment.</li>
            <li>1879 Louis discovers vaccinations
            
            Louis accidentally exposed chickens to a small form of cholera, and when the chickens didn't become sick he wanted to
            know why. He figured out the small exposure had worked as a vaccine against the actual sickness, and the vaccine was
            born.</li>
            <li>1885 A vaccine against rabies
            
            After finding vaccines for smallpox, TB, and cholera, Louis worked toward a vaccine for rabies. He found it in 1885.</li>
            <li>1888 The Pasteur Institute in Paris
            
            Louis' fame spread around the world, and soon donations began pouring in for the founding of the Pasteur Institute in
            Paris.</li>
            <li>1895 Louis is honored
            
            Louis was given the Leeuwenhoek medal, the highest honor in microbiology.</li>
            <li>1895 Louis Pasteur's death
            
            Louis Pasteur died in 1895. His paralysis had worsened after his stroke in 1868. Louis's contributions to society have
            saved millions of lives, and his legacy lives on today.</li>
